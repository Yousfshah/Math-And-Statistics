# ***Overview Of This Repo***
This GitHub repository is a curated collection of code and projects focused on the mathematical and statistical foundations essential for data science. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory, which form the bedrock of many data science algorithms and models. Additionally, the repository delves into statistical concepts and Tests such as descriptive and inferential statistics, hypothesis testing Parametric and Non-parametric Test.

### **Linear Algebra**
- Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of vectors, vector spaces, Matrices, Linear Equation and linear transformations. It's essentially the mathematics of straight lines and planes. ¬† 
    - Key components of linear algebra:
  
    `Vectors`: These represent quantities with both magnitude and direction, often visualized as arrows.

    `Linear equations`: Equations that can be expressed in the form of Ax+By=C. ¬† 

    `Matrices`: Rectangular arrays of numbers used to represent linear transformations and systems of equations.

    `Vector spaces`: Collections of vectors that satisfy certain properties.

    `Linear transformations`: Functions that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication.

### **Statistical Test**
A statistical test is a formal procedure for making decisions about a population based on sample data. It involves setting up hypotheses, collecting data, calculating a test statistic, and making a decision based on the test statistic's value.

**Statistical Tests**
1. `Anova Test` :\
    The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test is a statistical technique used to determine if there are significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. It helps in understanding if at least one of the group means is different from the others, which implies that the groups are not all the same. 
2. `T-Test` :\
    A T-test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features. It is a crucial tool in hypothesis testing when comparing two sample means or comparing a sample mean to a known population mean.
    
     - Types of T-Tests
  
        There are three main types of T-tests, each designed for specific situations:

      - One-Sample T-Test:

        Compares the mean of a single sample to a known population mean.
        Example: Testing if the average height of a group of students is different from the national average height.
      - Independent Samples T-Test (Two-Sample T-Test):

        Compares the means of two independent groups.
        Example: Comparing the test scores of two different classes to see if there is a significant difference.
      - Paired Sample T-Test (Dependent T-Test):

        Compares the means of two related groups.
        Example: Measuring the effect of a new teaching method by comparing students' scores before and after the method is applied.
3. `Chi Square Test`
   - A chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine if there's a relationship between two categorical variables.
    It compares the observed frequencies of data points with the expected frequencies. ¬† 
    Essentially, it helps you decide if two things are related or independent.

4. `Normal Distribution Test`
   - A normal distribution test is a statistical procedure used to determine if a dataset follows a normal distribution.
    A normal distribution, often called a "bell curve," is a symmetrical distribution where most data points cluster around the mean, with fewer data points occurring further from the mean.

     - Why is it important?
 
        Many statistical tests assume that the data is normally distributed. If the data is not normal, it can affect the results of these tests. Therefore, it's crucial to check for normality before applying certain statistical methods. ¬† 

      - Common normality tests include:
 
         Shapiro-Wilk test

         Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ¬† 

         Anderson-Darling test ¬†
