# ***Overview Of Linear Algebra***
- Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of linear equations, linear functions, and linear transformations. It is concerned with the properties of vectors and matrices, and how they can be used to model and solve problems in various fields. The main components of linear algebra include:

`Linear equations`: Equations that can be expressed in the form of Ax+By=C. 

`Vectors`: Quantities that have both magnitude and direction, often represented as arrays of numbers. 

`Matrices`: Rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

`Vector spaces`: A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors that can be added together and multiplied by numbers called scalars.


`Linear transformations`: A linear transformation is a special kind of function that takes vectors from one vector space and transforms them into vectors in another (or the same) vector space, while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
